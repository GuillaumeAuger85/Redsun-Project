Portfolio project i started half way of my Udemy training course.

In this project i wanted to exercise HTML, CSS and JS  knowledges covered through my Udemy training, 
before starting other sections of the course. 
The idea here was not to go for fast and most common pratices of web development
but rather taking the time to experiment doing things by myself like implementing parallax scrolling effect or play with the video API to recreate my own video player and many others.

Build a responsive portfolio for a sound design studio. 

Work in progress...
